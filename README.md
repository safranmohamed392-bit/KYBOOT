# Kyboot Shop

Modern, fully client‚Äëside demo storefront for showcasing ergonomic footwear. Built with **vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript** (no build tooling) featuring: animated ambient background, glass / normal UI modes, dynamic product grid (search + filter + sorting), accessible cart & mock checkout flow, popover dialogs, inline toasts, and performance‚Äëminded micro‚Äëinteractions.

| Feedback | Toast system, accessible dialogs (custom confirm), inline product add feedback, animated counters |
| Popovers | Terms & Conditions summary + full modal; Contact mini form with validation & keyboard trapping |
| Accessibility | ARIA roles, keyboard navigable cart & controls, focus trapping in dialogs/popovers, semantic HTML, reduced‚Äëmotion fallbacks |
| Performance | Lazy image loading, debounced resize for orbs, rAF usage for animation loops, lightweight (no dependencies) |
| Theming | Design tokens (CSS variables), dark ‚Äúglass‚Äù aesthetic vs standard light mode |

## üóÇ Project Structure

```
index.html       # Landing page (catalog, cart UI, mode toggle, animated background)
checkout.html    # Mock checkout flow pulling cart + product snapshot
styles.css       # Global styles, design tokens, animations, glass mode overrides
app.js           # All interactivity: product data, cart logic, UI effects, dialogs
README.md        # Project documentation (this file)
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

No build step required.

1. Download or copy the project folder (all files in the root).  
2. Open `index.html` directly in any modern browser.  
3. (Optional) Run from a lightweight static server for best results (caching / relative paths):
	```powershell
	# Python example (if available)
	python -m http.server 8080
	# Visit: http://localhost:8080/
	```
	Or use a ‚ÄúLive Server‚Äù style extension.
4. Interact: Add products ‚Üí open Cart ‚Üí proceed to Checkout ‚Üí place the mock order. The cart persists via localStorage.

## üß© Product Data Schema
Products live in `app.js`:
```js
{ id: string, title: string, price: number, category: string, description: string, image: string }
```
Add more by pushing objects into the `PRODUCTS` array. Ensure each `id` is unique.

## üõí Cart & Checkout Logic
- Cart stored under `localStorage key: kyboot_cart_v1`.
- Subtotal = Œ£ (price * qty).
- Shipping tiers (in checkout):
	- Standard: 25 QAR (FREE when subtotal ‚â• 500 QAR)
	- Express: 60 QAR
	- Pickup: 0 QAR
- Total = Subtotal + Shipping (no tax logic included; adapt if needed).
- ‚ÄúOrder Placed‚Äù just clears the cart + shows a dialog (no backend). You can replace that block with a real API call later.

## üé® Theming & Styling
Global design tokens (colors, radii, shadows, transitions) defined in `:root` (see top of `styles.css`). Glass mode overrides via `body.glass-mode`.

Toggle logic persists preference in `localStorage (kyboot_ui_mode)` with values: `glass` or `normal`.

### Disable Advanced Effects
If you want a simpler build:
1. Remove calls to `initBackgroundOrbs()`, `initBackgroundStreaks()`, `initCursorFX()`, `initTiltEffects()` in `DOMContentLoaded`.
2. Delete related CSS blocks (search for `.orb`, `.butterfly`, `.cursor-core`, `.tilt`).

## ‚ôø Accessibility Notes
- Dialogs & popovers: managed focus + ESC close.
- Buttons use `aria-label` where iconography implied meaning.
- Mode toggle acts as a switch (`role="switch"` with `aria-checked`).
- Reduced motion respected: media queries disable certain keyframe animations.
- Semantic headings & landmark elements (`header`, `main`, `footer`, `aside`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization Guide
| Task | Where | What to Edit |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Add product | `app.js` | Append to `PRODUCTS` array |
| Change currency | `app.js` & templates | Replace hardcoded `QAR` strings |
| Adjust free shipping threshold | `checkout.html` script | `if(subtotal >= 500)` condition |
| Replace images | Product objects | Update `image` URLs |
| Disable glass by default | `app.js` | Change logic in `DOMContentLoaded` (force `enableGlassMode(false)`) |
| Tweak animations | `styles.css` | Modify keyframes / transition variables |

## üîê Security / Disclaimer
Payment & order submission are purely demonstrative‚Äîno real processing, storage, or transmission occurs. Do **not** use this exact setup for production commerce without implementing:
- Server‚Äëside validation & stock checks
- CSRF protection & secure sessions / auth
- Real payment gateway (Stripe, Adyen, etc.)
- Proper privacy & data handling

## üìà Performance Considerations
- Lightweight (no frameworks) keeps bundle small.
- Lazy image loading via `loading="lazy"` in product cards.
- Debounced resize before regenerating background orbs.
- Intersection Observer defers cosmetic animations until visible.
- Inline minimal JS parsing overhead (one file) ‚Äî consider code‚Äësplitting if you grow features.

## üß™ Suggested Enhancements (Roadmap)
- Real backend (Node / Python / Go) for inventory & orders
- User authentication + order history
- Promo / coupon code engine
- Persistent shipping methods & addresses
- Currency & locale internationalization (i18n)
- Progressive Web App (installable + offline catalog)
- Unit tests (e.g., Jest + JSDOM) for cart logic
- Accessibility audit (axe) & Lighthouse budget file

## üõ† Modifying / Extending
- Copy the folder and edit files directly (no build tooling required).
- Add products by editing the `PRODUCTS` array in `app.js`.
- Adjust styling tokens at the top of `styles.css` for rapid theme changes.
- Replace or remove advanced visual effects by deleting related initializer calls (`initBackgroundOrbs`, `initCursorFX`, etc.).
- To integrate into a larger site, drop these files into a static hosting environment (Netlify, Vercel static export, S3, etc.).

## üßæ License
No explicit license file is included. Add a `LICENSE` (e.g., MIT) if you plan to redistribute. Until then, treat as ‚ÄúAll Rights Reserved‚Äù by the original author(s).

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting
| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Empty product grid | DOM not ready / script blocked | Ensure `<script src="app.js"></script>` is just before `</body>` and no 404 in console |
| Cart doesn‚Äôt persist | localStorage blocked (privacy mode) | Test in a normal session; wrap storage in try/catch (already implemented) |
| Animations feel heavy | GPU / older device | Disable advanced FX as described above |
| Glass mode unreadable | High contrast needs | Switch to normal mode toggle |
